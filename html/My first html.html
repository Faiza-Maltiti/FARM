    <h1>MY BIOGRAPHY</h1>
       <h2>My name is Abdul-Rahim Faiza Maltiti from Tamale in the northern region of Ghana.
    I attended T.I Ahmadiyya SHS where I read general science. I then proceeded to KNUST where i am currently studing biomedical engineering.
I chose biomedical engineering because I want to make medical devices accessibly by underserved communities</h2>
